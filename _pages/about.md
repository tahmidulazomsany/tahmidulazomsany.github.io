I am a PhD student in Climate Dynamics at George Mason University, VA, and a Graduate Research Assistant with the COLA Land Group under Professor Dr. Paul Dirmeyer. 

**My current research/project:** My research centers on land-atmosphere interactions, focusing on how large-scale photosynthesis influences climate feedbacks and the interconnections between carbon, water, and energy fluxes in terrestrial ecosystems. I utilize various global long-term datasets to explore the physical mechanisms driving these interactions.

**Skills/Tools:**
**Programming Languages:** Python, R, Bash Scripting, MATLAB, Mathematica, C
**Python Packages:** Cartopy, Metpy, Numpy, Pandas, Matplotlib, Tkinter, Machine
Learning(Scikit-learn, Keras, TensorFlow)
**ML Models:** CNN, CNN2D-LSTM, ANN, RNN etc.
**Other Skills:** Linux, HPC, Latex, HTML, CSS.
